# SHERO COSMETIC — Project Memory

**Last updated:** 2026-05-17
**Owner:** wickedbro (wecooked01@gmail.com)
**Location:** `/Users/wickedbro/Desktop/Tasarım/SHERO COSMETIC/Website`

## What this is

A static product-display brand landing for SHERO Cosmetic, a skincare brand
based in Istanbul. **Not a storefront** — sales happen on a separate channel
(Shopify, Amazon, retail partners, etc., TBD). CTAs on this site link out
with UTM tags.

## Scope decision (from onboarding session, 2026-05-17)

The user originally said "real brand launching for sale," which suggested a
full ecommerce build. They clarified: this specific site is **product
display only**, not the shop. That moved the whole project from "build a
storefront" to "polish a brand landing and wire real-world infra."

External store URL is **not yet provided** — placeholder for now.

## Current stack

Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS, with GSAP 3.12 + ScrollTrigger for animation.
Google Fonts. Python `http.server` for dev. No framework, no bundler, no
`package.json`. See `CLAUDE.md` for full stack snapshot.

## What was already built when I took over

- Hero slider (3 slides, hand-drawn SVG product bottles, autoplay + observer pause)
- Press marquee bar
- About section with stats and decorative SVG
- Ingredients grid (4 cards: Vit C, HA, Retinol, Niacinamide)
- 3-step skin quiz with concern-based product picks → result card
- "Build my routine" 5-step ladder
- Testimonials carousel (4 reviews, Turkish names — DTC voice)
- Contact form (client-side only, no backend wired)
- Footer with newsletter form (client-side only, no backend wired)
- Mobile nav drawer with backdrop, Escape-to-close, focus lock
- GSAP reveal animations with the `immediateRender:false + once:true` pattern

Bugs found during onboarding:
1. `script.js:255` — `querySelector(':scope::after')` is invalid; harmless
   dead code from iteration. Fixed in Phase 0.
2. Several `getElementById` calls on top-level module that throw if the ID
   is missing. All IDs currently exist; added optional-chaining for safety.
3. GSAP CDN scripts had no SRI integrity hashes. Fixed in Phase 0.
